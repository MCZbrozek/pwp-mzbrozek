        <h2><u>Target Persona</u></h2>
        <h3>Brigid Dawson</h3>
        <h4>"As the hiring manager of an international music streaming site, I am looking for a developer that can help us to boost streaming for small and mid-tier artists. I need a site that efficiently showcases the candidate's true skills and makes an impression right when the page loads." </h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Profession:</strong> Brigid is the hiring manager of a "freemium" media streaming platform with global reach. Brigid has been with this company since it's inception and has been the critical voice in the hiring process. She aims to find a candidate that is a strong cultural fit and has a solid skill baseline. She is proud of the low turn-over rate at her company and believes that her eye for personality types is what gives her company an edge. </li>

            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> As a hiring manager of a multi-billion dollar company, Brigid is always up-to-date with the latest technology. She predominantly uses a Windows computer at work, running Windows 10. Personal web browsing is conducted from her mobile device, a Google Pixel 6.</li>

            <li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Brigid is a big fan of delegating tasks, and automating as a means of creating space to live life away from her desk and enjoy time with her family. Brigid would like a bit more free time, but often has too many meetings during her work day to get everything done. She often takes work home with her, and what she can from her mobile device on the coach, or sometimes takes her laptop to a nearby brewery.</li>

            <li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Brigid has seen a million candidate sites as the company has grown. She has seen just about every gimmick in the book and has little patience for embedded videos, animations, or pop-ups. Daniel is looking for a display that is concise, elegant and efficient. </li>


            <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Brigid wants to see tasteful splashes of personality when she is visiting a candidate's page. When landing on the site, the layout needs to draw her into the page. Brigid wants clear access to the candidate's portfolio, with visual previews of each so that she can decide which is worth viewing in greater detail. Lastly, a working contact page helps her to reach out quickly if she is interested in candidate's work.  </li>

            <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Efficient, Friendly, Organized, Creative, Passionate, Collaborative.</li>
        </ul>
