<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<p>My site will be one page, and will include the following sections. </p>
<div class="Welcome">
    <h2>Page welcome:</h2>
    <p>Upon arrival to my page, visitors are greeted with a hero element featuring a one line introduction laid over an image of my self, or a landscape photograph. As the user begins to scroll down the page, the image begins to zoom in a while the next section comes up the page to cover the hero element image.</p>
    <p>The Navbar at the top of the page will feature quick links to page content sections and will collapse as the user scrolls down the page. The navbar will also house simple links to external content, such as: LinkedIn, GitHub, Strava.</p>


</div>
<div>
<h2>Portfolio:</h2>
    <p>The objective in this section, is to let my work speak for me. With the goal of showing the user a sample of my product <em>(in this case web development projects)</em> before they decide to build a relationship with me, by scrolling to the about me section below. </p>
    <p>As the user scrolls down below the hero image, the portfolio section will creep up the page. In this section, cards created with either screen capture or photo will grant a preview of my portfolio. The images will be laid on the left and right of the page in desktop view. The preview images will also utilize the zoom-scroll feature and will be staggered, vertically to add dimension to the page as the user scrolls. I may be able to create a mobile function that allow the user to see each preview image with the text to the left or right as they scroll in mobile view. </p>
</div>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>After the user has passed through the portfolio section, the next block of content will cover the last as the user scrolls. This section, will have 3 separate shapes filled with short paragraph descriptions of my education, work history, interests. Shapes will expand when clicked for more detailed descriptions. The shapes may be floating on top of a black and white image of me. </p>
<div>

</div>
<h2>Contact form:</h2>
    <p>Simple contact form with text box that will allow users to reach me. This section will also have social media links in case the user feels profoundly inspired to reach me on another platform. These will also be displayed in the footer with logo icons. </p>
<div>
